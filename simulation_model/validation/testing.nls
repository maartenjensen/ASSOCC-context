;;to be very cautions about: some variables might be overriden by an experiment
;;(e.g. an experiment playing with the number of hospital beds can leave an altered number of hospital beds at the end of the experiment)
;;normally, this issue should not occur when using the "loading" function, but it might (his variable should then be reset to the right value)
;; though, this voids the use of the autocalibrator, so be very wary when using it.
