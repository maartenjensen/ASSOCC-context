; Filename: context_state_sick_night.nls
; What we know from the context within these functions
; Location: Does not matter in implementation, as the agent just travels to the location where the agent can perform the action.
; Time: Night! Regardless of working day or non working day
; Age: All
; Sickness: The agent is sick
; Compliance is included

;Important needs (8 needs): 
;Sleep -> Rest at home
;Health -> Rest at home
;Risk avoidance -> Rest at home
;Belonging -> Rest at home (home, private leisure and public leisure give belonging however the agent should by default be at home when needing to sleep and when especially when sick)
;Autonomy -> Rest at home
;Compliance -> rest at home
;Conformity -> Depends on the network
;Leisure -> If critical, leisure at private leisure (since sick so doesn't want to go to public)

;Adjusted needs:
;None

;Code check:
; cssn: NOT csn, cso, csft, csso, cssft

; QUESTION?? Should the agent always social distance when sick??
