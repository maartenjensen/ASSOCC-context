The .bat file allows computing and displaying the core variables under study for the scenario 6.
For running it from you own computer, you just have to update the set_variables.bat for indicating where to find the .exe files in the .bat file such that it matches your setup.

Note that this a first version set up for my own config for not having to fiddle around too much with issues; bugs might still be in there.
