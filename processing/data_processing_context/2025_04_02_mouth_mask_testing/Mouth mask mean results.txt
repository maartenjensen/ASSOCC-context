Discussion:
We tested what would happen if an calculation is added to represent the calculation of mouth masks. To do this we added the social distancing calculation again, it is assumed that with such a calculation applying mouth masks could be calculated as well. The deliberation time of purely the DCSD increases by 7.7\%. The mean deliberation execution time of DCSD goes from 4659.8 ms to 5021.4 ms (when comparing with five runs). Then we have to account for the need-based deliberation that takes at least double the time 2302.3 ms (1151.1452 * 2), since the need-based deliberation was not adjusted. Adding these values 5021.4 for DCSD execution time and 2302.3 for need-based deliberation time gives us 7323.7 ms as hypothetical deliberation execution time. 

This means that in the deliberation in DCSD ASSOCC, assuming that we

Mean while Original ASSOCC takes 96010.5 ms for deliberation without mouthmasks. If we were to add the mouth mask sub action, it would at least double the deliberation execution time (if no hard cut outs are made, e.g. inside of home an agent does not wear a mouth mask so that action is removed). Doubling the deliberation execution time would mean 192021 ms, or 19.2 seconds for deliberation with Original ASSOCC in such a scenario.

Comparing DCSD and Original ASSOCC, while first there was a speed-up of 16.7 times (96010.5288/5761.3648). Now we calculate the speed-up by dividing 192021 by 7323.7, the speed-up is 26.2, which is much more than before. This shows that DCSD can potentially scale even better when the original model has even more deliberative aspects such as actions, but this would also work for needs.
